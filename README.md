Project Components:
1. Libraries Used:
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading the MNIST dataset from CSV files.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
Matplotlib: Used for data visualization, particularly for displaying images and results.
Scikit-learn: Used for train-test splitting and performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy and classification report.
TensorFlow and Keras: Used for building, compiling, and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
2. Dataset Loading and Preprocessing:
The MNIST dataset is loaded from CSV files (mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv) using Pandas.
Pixel values are normalized to be between 0 and 1.
3. Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split from Scikit-learn.
4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:
A CNN is defined using the Keras Sequential API.
Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling layers are used for feature extraction.
A dense layer with ReLU activation and a final dense layer with softmax activation for classification.
5. Model Compilation and Training:
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy as the loss function.
The model is trained on the training data for 10 epochs, with validation data used for monitoring.
6. Model Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its accuracy.
7. Predictions and Visualization:
The model makes predictions on a subset of the test set.
Actual and predicted labels, along with the corresponding images, are visualized using Matplotlib.
8. Classification Report:
A classification report is printed, providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, offering a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.
Expected Output:
The script outputs the test accuracy of the trained model on the MNIST dataset.
A set of images from the test set is displayed along with their true and predicted labels.
A detailed classification report is printed, providing insights into the model's performance for each digit class.
The primary objective is to create a CNN that accurately identifies handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset and to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. The output includes visualizations and metrics that help in assessing the effectiveness of the trained model.
