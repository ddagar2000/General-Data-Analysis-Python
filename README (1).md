# Student Analysis Report
This project analyzes the factors impacting students' exam scores using Python. By leveraging powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project uncovers insights into the relationships between various attributes and student performance.

Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to explore the following aspects and their influence on students' exam scores:

• Weekly Study Hours
Analyzing how the number of hours dedicated to studying each week correlates with student performance.

• Gender Distribution
Investigating gender-wise patterns and their impact on exam scores.

• Parent's Education and Student's Score
Examining the relationship between parents' education levels and their child's academic performance.

• Parent's Marital Status and Student's Score
Identifying how the marital status of parents correlates with students' scores.

• Distribution of Ethnic Group
Exploring the ethnic group distribution and its connection with exam scores.

# Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.

Seaborn: For generating advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

# Features and Methods

• Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handled missing values and cleaned raw data for consistency and accuracy.
Processed categorical and numerical data for meaningful analysis.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between study hours, gender, and scores using scatter plots and box plots.
Analyzed categorical variables like parents' education, marital status, and ethnic groups with bar charts and heatmaps.

• Key Findings

Identified patterns and trends affecting students' performance.
Highlighted significant factors impacting exam scores.
